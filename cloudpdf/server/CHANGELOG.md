# @cloudpdf/server

## 3.0.0-next.11

### Minor Changes

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Action reads served by `/v1/docs/:docId/actions@:token` (and the layer-scoped variant) now include interpreter payloads on every executable node and the destination-form `/OpenAction` as `openDestination`, via the shared engine-services reader. The wire representation of action nodes changed shape (payload-carrying discriminated union); deploy server and clients from the same prerelease train.

## 3.0.0-next.10

### Minor Changes

- [#788](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/788) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Persist per-layer annotation versions and add versioned page and
  whole-document annotation reads with audit-head metadata. Expose a no-store
  backend endpoint for listing every annotation in a layer. Annotation mutations
  now advance the version atomically so clients can hydrate and retry against
  coherent snapshots.

## 3.0.0-next.9

### Minor Changes

- [#772](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/772) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add document routes for inserting PDF pages, creating blank pages, and
  extracting selected pages. Insert mutations persist the new page set and
  versions atomically and publish audit events for realtime collaborators.

### Patch Changes

- [#787](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/787) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Reusing an explicit `docId` on `documents.init` or `documents.import` now answers a clean `409 Conflict` explaining how to proceed (retry with the same `idempotencyKey` to resume, delete the document to replace it, or use a different/omitted `docId`) instead of surfacing the raw database unique-constraint error as a 500 — including the case where a retry mints a fresh idempotency key per attempt. A `docId` already owned by another tenant answers `403`, mirroring the existing delete semantics.

- [#785](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/785) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Fix AWS S3-backed streaming uploads by buffering small source chunks before the SDK applies checksum framing, preventing `InvalidChunkSizeError` during document imports and other streamed writes. Handled 5xx responses now also emit structured error logs with the request ID and HTTP status.

## 3.0.0-next.8

### Minor Changes

- [#783](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/783) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add a production Helm chart with validated SQLite and Postgres profiles, safety gates, smoke and crash drills, and OCI publishing tied to the server package version. Add Prometheus metrics, drain-aware bounded shutdown and readiness, serialized Postgres migrations, and fail-fast worker supervision.

  Add opt-in supervised engine-host process isolation with generation-fenced recovery, crash journaling, document quarantine enforcement, engine health reporting, and audited quarantine CLI commands. Repeated engine crashers can be observed or rejected with `DocumentQuarantined`, while native host crashes restart the engine without terminating the API server.

  Encode page renders, annotation appearances, and warm thumbnails inside engine workers by default so compressed images cross the engine boundary, with a temporary API-side encoding fallback. Add bounded interactive and background scheduling, per-host memory telemetry, controlled engine recycling, and deterministic engine sharding with per-shard readiness and metrics.

  Add `POST /v1/docs/:docId/access` as the document-scoped access endpoint while retaining `POST /v1/access` as a transitional alias. Head responses advertise the scoped endpoint, and path/body document ID mismatches are rejected. Allow the optional `X-CloudPDF-Doc` affinity header through CORS and expose retry and image metadata response headers to browser clients.

## 3.0.0-next.7

### Patch Changes

- [#771](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/771) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Accepts bodyless requests that carry `Content-Type: application/json` instead of failing them with an unhandled 500.
  - An empty JSON body now parses as no body rather than `FST_ERR_CTP_EMPTY_JSON_BODY` — the shape the generated PHP, Go, and Ruby SDKs (and clients with default JSON headers) send for bodyless calls such as document delete. Non-empty bodies still go through Fastify's default parser, keeping its prototype-poisoning protection, and routes that require a body still reject its absence with a 400.
  - The error handler now honors Fastify's `statusCode` on framework errors, so parser and payload rejections (empty or malformed JSON, body limits) surface as the 4xx client errors they are instead of being logged and returned as "unhandled error" 500s.

## 3.0.0-next.6

### Minor Changes

- [#766](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/766) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add durable asynchronous document imports backed by the `document_imports` job table and an in-process worker with one claim loop per replica. Document and job creation is atomic, lease-token-fenced transitions prevent stale workers from overwriting replacements, reconcile-on-claim avoids duplicate transfers after crashes, and exhausted retries fail the document and clean destination bytes. Retries stay pinned to one content identity, filesystem sources require `expected.sha256`, and queued or running imports are protected from the stale-pending sweeper. Migration 027 stores the re-drivable source descriptor in `source_json`.

- [#766](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/766) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add operator-registered import connections through `CLOUDPDF_IMPORT_CONNECTIONS` for S3 and S3-compatible stores, GCS, Azure Blob, and filesystem roots. Connections enforce credential classes, tenant allowlists, scoped prefixes or tenant-bound key templates, provider-specific revision pinning, and fail-closed authorization. Canonical backend fingerprints reject self-imports, and each import records sanitized source provenance and outcome in the new `document_imports` table from migration 026. A shared conformance suite keeps URL and connection adapters aligned on source-opening behavior.

- [#766](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/766) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Implement server-side PDF imports from caller-supplied URLs through the existing document lifecycle. Deployment policy controls size, timeout, concurrency, HTTPS, and public-network requirements; URL handling blocks private and metadata addresses with DNS pinning, rejects redirects, and requires `Content-Length`. Imports enforce optional size and SHA-256 pins, sanitize failures so URL secrets do not leak, leave documents pending after retryable transport failures, and add the `pull` upload kind in migration 025.

### Patch Changes

- [#766](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/766) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Mount the document import handler under the renamed `documents.importFrom` contract operation and align the server's import policy and lifecycle terminology. The HTTP route and runtime behavior remain unchanged.

- [#766](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/766) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Cloud ObjectStore adapters (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) now truly stream `put` bodies: a `Readable` is hashed and length-enforced as it flows (constant memory) instead of being buffered whole. Under- or over-delivery aborts before a visible object can appear, any prior object at the key survives a failed attempt, and the SHA-256 metadata is attached post-stream (S3 via a same-key server-side copy). FsObjectStore now cleans up its `.partial` file when the source stream errors mid-put.

## 3.0.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- [#760](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/760) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Keep connected licenses usable during Keygen's three-day `EXPIRING` window by relying on the signed validation decision instead of the informational status label. Licenses whose expiry has elapsed remain denied.

## 3.0.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- [#750](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/750) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Preserves configured CORS response headers on the hijacked server-sent events stream, allowing browser clients on permitted origins to subscribe to document layer events.

## 3.0.0-next.3

### Minor Changes

- [#748](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/748) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Derives the connected usage-reporting credential from the license key, so a connected deployment is configured with `CLOUDPDF_LICENSE_KEY` alone.
  - Computes the reporting credential as `cpr_v1_` + base64url(HMAC-SHA256) over a domain-separated message that binds the signed `cloudpdfLicenseId` license metadata, so the wire credential is one-way (it can never reveal the license key) and never authenticates another license record.
  - Retires `CLOUDPDF_LICENSE_REPORTING_TOKEN`. A deployment that still sets it boots normally; the variable is ignored and the server logs a warning asking for its removal.
  - Existing connected deployments upgrade by removing the retired variable. During the coordinated verifier cutover on the CloudPDF side a usage report may answer 401; reports retry every five minutes with cumulative counters, so no usage is lost and license validation is unaffected.
  - Air-gapped deployments are unchanged and continue to send no telemetry.
  - Pins fixed cross-runtime derivation test vectors shared with the CloudPDF control plane.

- [#746](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/746) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Fixes presigned-upload materialization and makes commit-time sha verification single-read and constant-memory.
  - Fixes the range materializer crashing with `EBADF` whenever an object carried no SHA metadata — the shape of every presigned browser upload. The failure was silent: commits still reached `ready` while the security probe recorded `unknown` and thumbnail warming recorded `failed`. The hash fallback now closes the write-only handle and streams the finished partial from disk, guards against short positional writes, and rejects a metadata/expected-sha disagreement before paying for the download.
  - Replaces the S3 and FS `getSha256` fallbacks that buffered whole objects in RAM with streaming hashes — constant memory regardless of document size.
  - Commit now verifies uploaded bytes with a single object-store read when a base-file cache is wired (`DocumentLifecycleOptions.fileCache`): the upload is materialized into the cache, hashed on the way down, and reused by the security probe instead of being downloaded a second time. `LocalFileHandle.sourceKey` reports which object key materialized a content-addressed entry, so a cross-key cache hit still triggers a direct verification of the committing document's own object.
  - Adds a typed `ShaMismatchError` (exported) thrown by all `materializeLocal` implementations, letting callers distinguish declared-hash mismatches from retryable transport failures.
  - Surfaces previously swallowed failures: `DocumentSecurityProbeOptions.onError`, `DerivedRenderServiceOptions.onWarmError`, and base-file-cache `materialize-error` events are now wired to the server log.

## 3.0.0-next.2

### Minor Changes

- [#730](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/730) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Implements share grants, origin locking, per-tenant usage, and tenant suspension.
  - Stores share grants whose row id is the public share token, carrying document capabilities, an optional origin allowlist, an optional scrypt-hashed passphrase, a session TTL, and an optional expiry. Editing or deleting a grant retargets every embedded copy of its token at the next exchange.
  - Serves the public `POST /v1/share-sessions` exchange, which validates origin, passphrase, expiry, disablement, and tenant suspension before minting a document session JWT. Unknown, revoked, disabled, and suspended grants answer alike so the existence of a grant is never disclosed, and the route carries its own per-IP and per-grant limiters rather than the authentication-failure budget.
  - Enforces an optional `origins` claim on document tokens for every request that arrives with a browser `Origin` header, covering both share sessions and backend-minted tokens. Requests without the header are governed by the token itself.
  - Adds CORS through `CLOUDPDF_CORS_ORIGINS` (`*` to reflect, or a comma-separated allowlist), which browser-direct deployments need. Bearer tokens remain the security boundary; per-credential origin locks carry the origin policy a server-wide list cannot express.
  - Records per-tenant usage facts for views, uploads, and stored bytes, readable at `GET /v1/tenants/:tenantId/usage`. A view is a share exchange or an authorized `/v1/access` grant, counted once across the two. These counters hold no limits and are separate from license metering.
  - Adds `tenants.suspend` and `tenants.resume`, which fail every tenant JWT, document JWT, and share exchange closed while leaving the root API token free to inspect, resume, or delete the tenant.
  - Mounts token revocation from the CLI through `CLOUDPDF_ENABLE_REVOCATION`.
  - Records share and suspension lifecycle events in the security-event trail, and adds matching SQLite and PostgreSQL migrations plus origin, passphrase, and end-to-end share coverage.

- [#734](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/734) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Adds integrity-pinned uploads with presigned storage transfer preferred and a
  policy-controlled multipart proxy fallback.

  Hardens filesystem-backed storage against path traversal, storage-root deletion,
  and recursive deletion through symbolic links.

## 3.0.0-next.1

### Major Changes

- [#720](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/720) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Adds the tenant-scoped backend API and root API-token workflow to the self-hosted CloudPDF server.
  - Replaces the legacy flat admin routes with contract-backed `/v1/tenants/:tenantId` document, tenant, token, and deployment operations.
  - Adds constant-time root API-token authentication alongside delegated tenant JWT authorization.
  - Adds tenant lifecycle and provenance tracking, keyset pagination and state filtering, and cascade deletion for tenant-owned data.
  - Adds document and tenant token issuance, revocation, and durable security-event auditing.
  - Allows API tokens on document-plane routes and supports per-request `X-Document-Password` authorization through HMAC proofs or non-mutating checks against the canonical PDFium session, including credential-safe open singleflight behavior.
  - Adds matching SQLite and PostgreSQL migrations plus expanded registry, authorization, password, and end-to-end coverage.

## 3.0.0-next.0

### Major Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/711) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Introduces the self-hostable CloudPDF document server. The Fastify service combines authentication, durable storage, native PDF processing, realtime document events, and commercial license enforcement behind the Engine v3 HTTP API.
