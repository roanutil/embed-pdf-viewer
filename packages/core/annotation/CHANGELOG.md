## 3.0.0-next.11

### Minor Changes

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Session-visibility overlay: `Model.sessionHidden` with `setSessionHidden`/`forgetSessionHidden`/`clearSessionHidden` messages, composed through the new `effFlags`/`effBearer` lenses so Hide actions and scripts flip presentation-only visibility (paint, hit-testing, selectability, handles) without ever touching the document `/F` flags — and a session-SHOWN annotation is live, not painted-but-dead. The overlay survives page reloads and is forgotten only on true deletes.

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – `sessionHidden`, `effFlags`/`effBearer`, and the session-visibility messages are REMOVED — visibility is document truth again (`/F` flags, mutated through the normal write path), and every paint/hit/selection gate reads the annotation's own flags.

## 3.0.0-next.10

### Minor Changes

- [#788](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/788) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add comment-thread and review-state composition, attached-link substrate
  helpers, conversation-plane filtering, and per-record annotation authority.
  Align annotation grouping, hit testing, geometry, and sparse property updates
  with the new comments, links, and permission model.

### Minor Changes

- [#755](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/755) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Model carets anchored to rotated text as oriented box geometry.
  - Add `caretGeomFromAnchor`, which places the caret at the trailing glyph edge and derives its authoring rotation from the text baseline while preserving the previous byte-identical upright geometry.
  - Carry optional rotation on caret geometry, apply it to local-frame hit testing, and expose an oriented selection outline without enabling caret rotate or resize gestures.

- [#755](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/755) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Models text-markup annotations with semantic text quads and adds oriented caret anchors, allowing highlight, underline, strikeout, squiggly, caret, and replace-text geometry to follow the selected text frame.

### Major Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/711) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Introduces the rebuilt annotation domain core. It contains the framework-free annotation model, update/effect logic, content-space geometry, hit testing, and drawing-tool behavior shared by every UI integration.
