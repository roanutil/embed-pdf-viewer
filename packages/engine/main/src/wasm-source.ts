/**
 * Where does `embedpdf.wasm` come from?
 *
 * The wasm binary is the ONE runtime-fetched asset of the local engine.
 * Everything else (the worker code) travels through the module graph, so it
 * never needs bundler asset handling — but the 6 MB binary is fetched at
 * runtime from a plain URL, resolved here on the MAIN THREAD (the worker
 * never guesses) in a fixed precedence order:
 *
 *   1. `wasmBinary`  — caller-supplied bytes, zero network (air-gapped).
 *   2. `wasmUrl`     — exact URL.
 *   3. `assetsUrl`   — base directory; `embedpdf.wasm` is appended.
 *   4. the default   — depends on how the worker itself is delivered:
 *      - inline blob worker (the zero-config path): SIBLING-FIRST. The
 *        bundler-resolved URL from `@embedpdf/engine-runtime-wasm32/wasm-url`
 *        (the wasm ships inside the consumer's own build), with the
 *        version-pinned jsDelivr URL as a fetch-failure-only fallback. A blob
 *        worker has no meaningful location, so both URLs are resolved here on
 *        the main thread and must be absolute.
 *      - a real worker URL / caller-built worker: nothing is sent, and the
 *        Emscripten glue resolves `embedpdf.wasm` as a SIBLING of the worker
 *        script (`import.meta.url`). Copying `embedpdf-worker.js` and
 *        `embedpdf.wasm` into one directory is a complete self-host setup, and
 *        bundler-emitted workers (Vite `?worker`) keep their bundler-managed
 *        asset next to the worker chunk.
 */

/**
 * How to deliver a Web Worker:
 * - `'inline'` (default): spawn from a blob URL built from the worker source
 *   string shipped inside this package. Zero configuration in any bundler and
 *   on any CDN; requires `worker-src blob:` under a strict CSP.
 * - a URL string: a same-origin static worker file (strict-CSP setups — copy
 *   it from this package's `workers/` directory).
 * - a `Worker` or `() => Worker`: full control (bundler-native
 *   `new Worker(new URL(...))`, custom worker builds, shared lifecycles).
