## 3.0.0-next.11

### Minor Changes

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – `createDefaultActionsUiAdapter` — the actions UI adapter's DEFAULT policy (the origin×phase visibility matrix: hover/lifecycle prints suppressed, boot/lifecycle alerts suppressed, sanitizeExternalUri URI opens, browser fallbacks), hoisted here and written ONCE so every framework binding (react, angular) ships the same behavior instead of forking it. Structural twins keep this package plugin-free per the layering law; `overrides` accepts a getter for late-bound handlers.

### Minor Changes

- [#775](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/775) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add shared browser Stage surface and touch gesture controllers with lens-scoped input, pan, pinch, fling, double-tap, long-press, and wheel handling. Export vibration and native-shell feedback providers.

- [#776](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/776) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add a shared native DOM binding for selection-handle drags that shields Stage gestures and handles pointer capture and client-delta tracking.

## 3.0.0-next.6

### Minor Changes

- [#768](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/768) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add `bindPaintedImage`, a framework-neutral browser adapter for binding object-URL raster sources to image elements. It hides incomplete images, owns abort and URL-revocation cleanup, and reports painted and unpainted state around the image's presented lifetime so React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular adapters can share the same minimal lifecycle.

## 3.0.0-next.5

### Minor Changes

- [#759](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/759) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add framework-neutral anchored-overlay projection and placement utilities for Stage and standalone page surfaces. Add browser clipboard helpers for selected-text prefetch, native copy events, keyboard fallback, and user-initiated clipboard writes while keeping selection plugins DOM-free.

### Major Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/711) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Introduces framework-independent browser adapters for EmbedPDF v3. It centralizes DOM-facing services such as file selection, clipboard access, printing, downloads, and external navigation so core packages remain platform-neutral.
