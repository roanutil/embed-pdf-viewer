## 3.0.0-next.12

### Minor Changes

- [#803](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/803) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – The Insert tab's Stamp action now opens the stamps sidebar instead of a click-then-pick file dialog; the Image action handles arbitrary PNG and JPEG insertion. The sidebar is now the classic picker over real libraries. Its built-in library comes from `@embedpdf/default-stamps` — the standard rubber stamps as one Acrobat-compatible PDF per locale — loaded on the panel's first open (never at boot), in the locale negotiated from the viewer's language and the browser's, and swapped when the viewer's locale changes; the canvas-drawn placeholder set is gone. The panel gets a library dropdown ("All stamps" plus one entry per library, shown once there are two), a two-column thumbnail grid with the label as tooltip, a hover `×` that removes a stamp from a user library, and per-library export as PDF and remove. Custom libraries persist in IndexedDB across reloads.

  "Make stamp" joins the annotation selection strip: with one or more annotations selected on a page, it turns their appearances into a vector stamp in a "My stamps" library and opens the panel on it. Widgets and pending redaction marks are excluded.

  New `stamps` option on the viewer customization: `stamps: { defaultLibrary: false }` ships no built-in library and makes no request (air-gapped); `stamps: { defaultLibrary: 'https://your.cdn/{locale}/stamps.pdf' }` self-hosts a copy of `@embedpdf/default-stamps`. The default is the copy that ships with the viewer, loaded as a lazy chunk of your own build; nothing is ever fetched from a third party. English and Spanish strings updated.

### Patch Changes

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – The viewer wires the action engine in: `actionsPlugin()` joins the plugin set and the Shell installs the default URI/Print UI adapter.

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – The chrome save/print commands become the Phase-4 verb owners: `document:download` runs WS → serialize → DS as ONE queued operation (the WillSave mutations are IN the downloaded bytes; two rapid saves can never interleave) and `document:print` runs WP → `window.print()` → DP under the reentrancy latch — both degrading to today's behavior when the actions plugin is absent.

- [#793](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/793) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Scripting migrates to `actionsPlugin({ javascript: { enabled: true } })` with a bare `formPlugin()`; the Shell's form scripting provider hook is gone — `useActionsUiAdapter` carries everything.

### Minor Changes

- [#788](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/788) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add a comments and review sidebar with loading, retry, and navigation states,
  plus an anchored editor for annotation links. Commands and controls now
  reflect document and per-record permissions, with updated locale strings for
  the new states.

### Minor Changes

- [#775](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/775) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Enable draggable touch selection handles and register vibration feedback by default when the platform supports it.

## 3.0.0-next.6

### Patch Changes

- [#768](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/768) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Adopt the unified `RenderLayer` page composition so the full viewer gets policy-driven deep-zoom tiling without mounting a separate tile layer. Base and sharp tile pixels now follow one rendering lifecycle through zoom, pan, annotation, and page-view surfaces.

## 3.0.0-next.5

### Minor Changes

- [#759](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/759) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add a floating text-selection strip with permission-aware Copy, native keyboard clipboard wiring, localized labels, and shared contextual-strip rendering. A successful menu copy clears the unchanged selection so both its highlight and menu dismiss, while failed or superseded copies preserve the current selection.

### Major Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/711) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Introduces the shared implementation package for the full viewer interface. It contains the measured toolbar, menus, panels, responsive layout, and default feature composition consumed by the distributable viewer packages.
