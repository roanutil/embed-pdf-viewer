/**
 * @embedpdf/viewer — the SNIPPET door (`dist/embedpdf.js`).
 *
 * ```html
 * <div id="viewer" style="height:100vh"></div>
 * <script type="module">
 *   import EmbedPDF from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@embedpdf/viewer@VERSION/dist/embedpdf.js';
 *   EmbedPDF.init({ target: '#viewer', src: '/report.pdf' });
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 * The same local door, with one line of difference: the default wasm location.
 * Loaded as a real URL module, this door SELF-LOCATES — `embedpdf.wasm` ships
 * in the dist folder, and Vite hands this import back as a URL relative to
 * whichever chunk ends up holding it (`?no-inline` makes it a file, not
 * base64). It resolves against wherever the folder lives: jsDelivr when
 * served from jsDelivr, an internal server when the folder is copied there.
 * No CDN URL is baked in: air-gapping the snippet is "copy the dist folder",
 * zero config. An explicit `engine` config still overrides it.
