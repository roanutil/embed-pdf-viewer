/**
 * The KERNEL's public surface — everything every door exports, which is

 * the only thing doors disagree about.
 *
 * See ../../DOORS.md for the laws. The one that matters here: nothing under
 * `kernel/` may import from `doors/` or `local/`. Read that as "the word
 * 'local' cannot appear in this directory" and the rest follows.
