'@embedpdf/viewer': patch
---

The built-in stamp library ships inside the viewer instead of being fetched from a CDN. The npm entry keeps `@embedpdf/default-stamps/library` external, so its locale modules become lazy chunks of your own build; the CDN snippet carries them as sibling chunks in its folder. `@embedpdf/default-stamps` is now a dependency. Previously a library build could inline the eight PDFs into the JS chunk as base64, a form webpack rejects.

The CDN snippet (`dist/embedpdf.js`) once again finds `embedpdf.wasm` when loaded from another origin: the wasm is now an asset Vite emits into the dist folder and references by a URL relative to whichever chunk needs it, instead of a path guessed against the entry file — which had resolved to `chunks/embedpdf.wasm` and failed. A cross-origin test (`pnpm test` in the viewer package, Playwright against the built artifact) now guards it: the snippet must render with every sibling fetched from its own folder and no request to any other origin.
